Welcome to Oil Spill
Story
----------------------------
A large cargo ship carrying a stupendous amount of oil has Capsized!

You are a contractor hired to clean up oil. You need to clean up all of this oil 
before any more wild life can tragically die.

As well as this there is the slight problem of the oil mutating and forming
monsters, you will have to kill these to clean up the oil.

This is resulting in an influx of deadly oil in to the natural ecosystem,
killing nearly all of the wild life.

Good luck with your job.
